\chapter{SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}
    \section{Functional Requirements}
    Functional requirements define the fundamental actions that system must perform. The functional requirements for the system are divided into three main categories: Reservation, Food, and Management. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reservation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system shall reservations.
            \item The system shall record the customer's information such as: their first name, last name, phone number.
            \item The system shall record the number of occupants.
            \item The system shall record the room number.
            \item The system shall display the room rate.
            \item The system shall generate a unique confirmation number for each reservation.
            \item The system shall automatically cancel reservations after 6 hours check-in time if the customer has not checked in.
            \item The system shall record the expected check-in date.
            \item The system shall record the expected checkout date.
            \item The system shall record the airport transfer booking (if any).
            \item The system shall check in customers.
            \item The system shall allow reservations to be modified some information.
            \item The system shall check out customers.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The system shall display the amount owed by the customer.
                \item The system shall record that the room status is available.
                \item The system shall record the invoice.
            \end{itemize}
            \item The system shall record customer feedback.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Food
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system shall track all meals purchased in the hotel.
            \item The system shall bill the current room if payment is not made at the time of service.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Management 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system shall display the hotel occupancy for a specified period (days).
            \item The system shall display projected occupancy for a period of time (days).
            \item The system shall display room revenue.
            \item The system shall display food revenue.
            \item The system shall display customer feedback.
            \item The system shall allow manager to create new user.
            \item The system shall allow for the addition of information, regarding rooms, rates, menu items, prices, reservations and user profile.
            \item The system shall allow for the modification of information, regarding rooms, rates, menu items, prices, reservations and user profile.
            \item The system shall allow for the deletion of information, regarding rooms, rates, menu items, prices, and user profile.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \section{Non-functional Requirements}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Performance
\newline Performance requirements define acceptable response time for system functionality.
        \item Security
        \newline Security is also a major factor that needs to be handled carefully on every web application that allows
the user to log in with accounts. The information provided by the users will be stored in a private database and the user’s password will be hashed before storing in order to protect it from being exposed. HMS also has a separate route for the administrators to access the admin dashboard and prevent unauthorized access from normal users. 
        \item Availability
\newline     HMS is expected to be available 24 hours a day and the users can access the website at any time. Users can access the website from anywhere in the world, however, for receptionists and managers, need to log in with their account (provided before) to access all the functionalities of the website.
        \item Maintainability
\newline        The hotel requirements are rapidly changing with the open economy and the system must be able to change rapidly. So to develop a new system in each change is not a possible task. So re-usability of components and maintainability of the system are very important.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{DFD Level-0}
* Overview \\
The below Data Flow Diagram (DFD) represents a Level-0 diagram for a Hotel Management System (HMS), focusing on several key processes and their interactions with external entities and data stores. The diagram includes the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Guest Interactions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Check for Available Rooms: The users initiate a room search query, and the system returns room results.
        \item Send Feedback: Guests can provide feedback, which is stored in the HMS's feedback data store.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Room and Reservation Management:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manage Room: This process involves updating room information based on guest check-ins, check-outs, and reservations.
        \item Book Room: Guests can book rooms, and the system records the booking information in the reservation data store.
        \item Check-In and Check-Out Processes: These are represented as individual processes, handling reservation information and updating the system accordingly.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Feedback:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Review Guest Feedback: The manager can review feedback from guests stored in the feedback data store, facilitating improvements in service quality.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Accounting:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Search Invoice: The accountant can search for invoices based on reservation IDs, and view invoice history, with all invoices stored in a dedicated invoice data store.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Meal and Transport Services:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manage Menu Item: This process involves updating meal information in the meal data store.
        \item Book Meals: Guests can book meals, and the system records meal details.
        \item Book Airport Transfer Service: Guests can book transport services, with booking information stored in a transport data store.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The diagram shows various data stores like Room, Feedback, Reservation, Invoice, Meal, Guest, and Transport, each storing relevant information for their respective processes. Entities like Guests, Managers, Receptionists, and Accountants interact with the system, providing inputs like queries, and information, and receiving outputs like room results and invoice details. This DFD provides a high-level overview of the core processes and data interactions within a Hotel Management System.
